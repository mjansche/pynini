Description: Pynini is a Python extension module which allows the user to compile,
        optimize, and apply grammar rules. Rules can be compiled into weighted
        finite state transducers, pushdown transducers, or multi-pushdown
        transducers. For general information and a detailed tutorial, see
        [pynini.opengrm.org](http://pynini.opengrm.org).
        
        Pynini is primarily developed by [Kyle Gorman](mailto:kbg@google.com)
        with the help of contributors. If you use Pynini in your research, we

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Pynini depends on:
        
        -   A standards-compliant C++ 11 compiler (GCC &gt;= 4.8 or
            Clang &gt;= 700)
        -   The most recent version of [OpenFst](http://openfst.org) (at the
            time of writing, 1.6.9) built with the `far`, `pdt`, `mpdt`, and
            `script` extensions (i.e., built with `./configure --enable-grm`)
            and headers
        -   A recent version of [re2](http:://github.com/google/re2) (at the
            time of writing, tag `2018-09-01`; issue
            `git checkout 2018-09-01; git pull` from the `re2` directory to sync
            to this tag) and headers
        -   [Python 2.7 or 3.6+](https://www.python.org) and headers
        
        It is tested with: Debian Linux 4.9.82 on x86\_64, GCC 7.3, Cython
        0.28.5, and Python 2.7.13 and Python 3.7.0.
        
        Installation instructions
        =========================
        
        Execute `python setup.py install`. Depending on your environment, you
        may need to be superuser while running this command for installation to
        complete.
        
        To confirm successful installation, execute `python setup.py test`.
        
        Python 3 support
        ================
        
        Python 3 support is available as of Pynini 2.0.0.
