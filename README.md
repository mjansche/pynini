This is a read-only unofficial mirror of [Pynini](http://opengrm.org/Pynini).

This is simply a mirror of recent Pynini releases, for convenience. Pynini was not developed here, the project is not active here, it does not accept pull requests here, and there is no issue tracker or wiki here. For all of these things, the [official Pynini page](http://opengrm.org/Pynini) is the best place to go.
