Pynini is a Python extension module which allows the user to compile,
optimize, and apply grammar rules. Rules can be compiled into weighted
finite state transducers, pushdown transducers, or multi-pushdown
transducers. For general information and a detailed tutorial, see
[pynini.opengrm.org](http://pynini.opengrm.org).

Pynini is primarily developed by [Kyle Gorman](mailto:kbg@google.com)
with the help of contributors. If you use Pynini in your research, we
would appreciate if you cite the following paper:

Dependencies
============

Pynini depends on:

-   A standards-compliant C++ 11 compiler (GCC &gt;= 4.8 or Clang &gt;= 700)
-   The most recent version of [OpenFst](http://openfst.org) (at the time of
    writing, 1.7.0) built with the `far`, `pdt`, `mpdt`, and `script` extensions
    (i.e., built with `./configure --enable-grm`) and headers
-   A recent version of [re2](http://github.com/google/re2) (at the time of
    writing, tag `2019-01-01`; issue `git checkout 2019-01-01; git pull origin
    master` from the `re2` directory to sync to this tag) and headers
-   [Python 2.7 or 3.6+](https://www.python.org) and headers

It is tested with: Debian Linux 4.18.10 on x86\_64, GCC 7.3.0, Cython 0.29 and
Python 2.7.13 and Python 3.7.1.
