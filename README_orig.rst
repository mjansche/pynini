Pynini is a Python extension module which allows the user to compile, optimize,
and apply grammar rules. Rules can be compiled into weighted finite state
transducers, pushdown transducers, or multi-pushdown transducers. For general
information and a detailed tutorial, see
`pynini.opengrm.org <http://pynini.opengrm.org>`__.

Pynini is primarily developed by `Kyle Gorman <mailto:kbg@google.com>`__ with
the help of contributors. If you use Pynini in your research, we would
appreciate if you cite the following paper:

    K. Gorman. 2016. `Pynini: A Python library for weighted finite-state
    grammar compilation
    <http://openfst.cs.nyu.edu/twiki/pub/GRM/Pynini/pynini-paper.pdf >`__. In
    *Proc. ACL Workshop on Statistical NLP and Weighted Automata*, 75-80.

Dependencies
------------

Pynini depends on:

-  A standards-compliant C++ 11 compiler (GCC >= 4.8 or Clang >= 700)
-  The most recent version of `OpenFst <http://openfst.org>`__ (at the time of
   writing, 1.6.8) built with the ``far``, ``pdt``, ``mpdt``, and ``script``
   extensions (i.e., built with ``./configure --enable-grm``) and headers
-  A recent version of `re2 <http:://github.com/google/re2>`__ (at the time of
   writing, tag ``2018-04-01``; issue ``git checkout 2018-04-01; git pull``
   from the ``re2`` directory to sync to this tag) and headers
-  `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org>`__ and headers

It is tested with: Debian Linux 4.9.82 on x86\_64, GCC 7.3, Python 2.7.13,
Cython 0.28.3.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Execute ``python setup.py install``. Depending on your environment, you may
need to be superuser while running this command for installation to complete.

To confirm successful installation, execute ``python setup.py test``.

Python 3 support
----------------

Pynini is not regularly tested using Python 3 but it should work with some
modifications, assuming you have Cython (a Python-to-C transpiler). Minimally,
you will want to regenerate ``pywrapfst.cc`` and ``pynini.cc`` (in the ``src``
directory) like so:

::

    cython -3 --cplus -o pywrapfst.cc pywrapfst.pyx
    cython -3 --cplus -o pynini.cc pynini.pyx

and then (re)compile as described above. There are still some warts related to
the switch from byte to Unicode strings which will be handled in a future
version.
